Was looking for something lighter weight than node.js and
socket.io, or python and socket.io.

Wanted only gevent and websockets if possible, in this case
add Flask which is pretty light weight anyhow.

Blog post inspiration (and code to begin with) for this
project:

And using the gevent websocket project:

OS X

I installed Gevent via mac ports, the exact port being
py27-gevent @0.13.8_0, but you can install the version for
the python you are using (from ports).

I am sure homebrew or some other install will also work.
Message me and let me know.

Plans
------

Wire up MongoDB and Redis, make a simple light 
communication chanels.
