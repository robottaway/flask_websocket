Was looking for something lighter weight than node.js and
socket.io, or python and socket.io.

Wanted only gevent and websockets if possible, in this case
add Flask which is pretty light weight anyhow.

Blog post inspiration (and code to begin with) for this
project:

And using the gevent websocket project:
